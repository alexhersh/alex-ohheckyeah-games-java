OhHeckYeah
==========

The [OhHeckYeah](http://ohheckyeah.com) video games, written with Java & [Procesing](http://processing.org), built on top of [Haxademic](https://github.com/cacheflowe/haxademic-2/).

#### TODO

* Wireless Kinect controls
* Usage tracking
* Common hug-it-out screen with OHY theme music callout
* Overhead Kinect control? (Wait to see if Kinect zoom lens helps)
* Documentation / instructions - people should be able to install these games on their own

Catchy
==========

Catchy is a 2-player Kinect-based video game, and the first official [OhHeckYeah](http://ohheckyeah.com) game. Designed by Legwork and developed by Mode Set, this 2-player game is all about catching the good stuff falling from the sky, and getting out of the way of the bad stuff. Whoever catches the most goodness by the end of the round, wins!

Watch the trailer on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/93886700).

##### Running Catchy (from OS X)


* Make sure the machine is set to 1024 x 768
	* Open System Preferences
	* Click Displays
	* When plugged into a projector, make sure to "mirror" the displays at this resolution in the "Arrangement" tab
	* Set "Resolution" to "Scaled" and click 1024x768
* Make sure the Kinect is plugged into a USB port on the computer and plugged into a power outlet
* Start Eclipse from the Mac Dock or Applications directory
* If you've pulled updated code via GitHub, make sure to follow the update instructions below
* Find the larger green "play" button in the top bar in Eclipse, and click the tiny "down arrow" to the right
* Select "Catchy" and the game will launch
* If any error windows pop up, make sure to press "Ignore", and (force) quit the game as described below
	* I've had to unplug and replug the Kinect USB once when I kept getting errors on launch, but this shouldn't happen


##### TODO

* Improve 1-player layout

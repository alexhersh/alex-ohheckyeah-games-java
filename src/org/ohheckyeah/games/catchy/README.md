Catchy
==========

Catchy is a 2-player Kinect-based video game, and the first official [OhHeckYeah](http://ohheckyeah.com) game. Designed by Legwork and developed by Mode Set, this 2-player game is all about catching the good stuff falling from the sky, and getting out of the way of the bad stuff. Whoever catches the most goodness by the end of the round, wins!

##### TODO

* Improve 1-player layout

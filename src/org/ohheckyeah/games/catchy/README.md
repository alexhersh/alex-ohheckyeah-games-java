# Catchy

Catchy is a 2-player Kinect-based video game, and the first official [OhHeckYeah](http://ohheckyeah.com) game. Designed by Legwork and developed by Mode Set, this 2-player game is all about catching the good "stuff" falling from the sky. Whoever catches the most goodness by the end of the round, wins!

KacheOut is a 2-player Kinect-based video game, originally created for the big LED screen at Create Denver Week 2012. It was based on a mashup of classic game concepts from Breakout, Pong and Space Invaders. It has since been installed at a number of events like Bordo Bello, Denver Startup Week, Boulder/Denver New Tech, Sub.Mission and the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art. In 2013, it was also used as a prototype to pitch ArtPlace on the grant that brought [OhHeckYeah](http://ohheckyeah.com) into existence.
